# Bottom Sheets Dialog
One of the most significant changes to Android design was introduced during the 2014 Google I/O conference, [material design](https://material.google.com/components/bottom-sheets.html). Even though Google had introduced a set of guidelines for their new design philosophy, developers were responsible for implementing the new patterns from scratch.

As with many things in software development, the Design support library improved with time, adding support for [bottom sheets](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-sheets.html) with the 23.2 release.
